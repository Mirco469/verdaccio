# verdaccio

The content of htpasswd was generated after running `npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873/` and adding a user with username test, password test and email test@test.com

At some point the password changed because the algorithm used changed from "crypt" to "bcrypy" following a warning in the console (algorithm changed in config.yaml)

Set max_users: -1 to disable new user registrations
